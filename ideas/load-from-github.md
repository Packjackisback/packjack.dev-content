title: Loading from github

I'm not sure why, but because I wanted to run casaos on my old laptop, I've restricted myself to using only docker containers. This worked great for things like Navidrome and slskd, but running my own apis and websites is a huge pain. Right now, to load things to the server I have to build and push the docker image, then go into the server and update the container. Rather than fixing the actual issue, I'm going to make this need to happen less by loading content from this markdown repo

When I was a little kid, the only source of music was whatever my parents played, and their old iPod. This shaped a lot of my early music tastes, and my comfort music (i switch around a lot now), and it had a lot of songs that I thought were a LOT more popular than they were. One of these songs I simply cannot find, it had a line about "the big guns" and it was a classic rock ish song (not by acdc).

Unrelated tangent aside, my uncle gave me a usb of music when I was probably 10, and one of those songs was sour times by portishead. I didn't love the song then, but in a random rym youtube compilation I heard it, and the punch of nostalgia was so strong that I added it to my rotation for a few days. Something about the slow, almost nauseating pace of the song is comforting, and it reminds me of the feeling when your brain repeats a word in your head over and over again echoing it and making you nauseous.
